Specific details include: EXACT marketing methods used to find properties (direct mail, PPC, Bandit signs, etc), techniques for buying and selling the deals, next level closing strategies, and even the exact dollar amount made on the deal! Bam!!\n\nWhether you’re a newbie or a seasoned wholesaler, if you’ve ever thought about starting (or exploding) a wholesaling business, you’re in the right place.\n\nCome be a fly on the wall and listen in on these conversations as our guest’s spill their guts. It could be the only Podcast you ever need to listen to."}, "im:price":{"label":"Get", "attributes":{"amount":"0", "currency":"USD"}}, "im:contentType":{"attributes":{"term":"Podcast", "label":"Podcast"}}, "rights":{"label":"© 2016 Copyright  | Investor Grit, LLC Disclaimer: The information contained in this podcast is for general information purposes only.
